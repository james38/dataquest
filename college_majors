#Use the /Total column to calculate the number of people who fall under each /Major_category and 
#store the result as a separate dictionary for each dataset. The key for the dictionary should be 
#the /Major_category and the value should be the total count. For the counts from /all_ages, store 
#the results as a dictionary named /all_ages_major_categories and for the counts from /recent_grads, 
#store the results as a dictionary named /recent_grads_major_categories.
